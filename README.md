## Can you walk me through your typical UX design process?

The candidate should break down the process of design thinking, including each process within a sprint. They should demonstrate complete confidence in their personal research methods and structured methodologies. 

## How do you prioritize features and design elements when working on a project with tight deadlines?

This is all about targeting the right part of the application. We are talking about the Minimum Viable Product and the Most Valuable Point within the product cycle. The candidate should demonstrate an awareness of prioritization on value. 

## How do you incorporate user feedback into your design process?

Any suitable answer should include standard specific UX research methods, including but not limited to UX Research Interviews, A/B Testing, Usability Testing Sessions, and Card Sorting, as well as Diary Studies and Stakeholder Reviews. 

## How do you integrate business objectives into your UX design process while maintaining user focus?

This should be answered by the candidate demonstrating an understanding of a balance between business objectives and user needs. Namely, the candidate should discuss the process of looking for opportunities within the service pipeline, including details such as marketing opportunities, brand opportunities, and value opportunities.   

## How do you stay updated with the latest trends and best practices in UX design?

Any answer such as, "I subscribe to different channels on social media," or "I read," should suffice. Trendy answers will include, "I read product update docs from Figma," and "I surf Medium 24/7." 

## Can you discuss a time when you had to advocate for UX design principles to stakeholders or team members who were resistant?

This will be an opportunity for the candidate to flex their ability to persuade and describe with confidence the value of good UX, clean time and product management, and organizational structure.

## Real World Scenario. 

A company has developed a niche productivity tool designed specifically for remote teams in the legal industry. Despite having a solid user base, feedback indicates that users find certain features unintuitive, and there are unexplained drop-offs in engagement. Describe which UX research methods you would utilise during specifically the discovery phase and explain why qualitative over quanitative methods may be preferred.
